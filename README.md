# Homework Description:
After creating a strategy class for the current strategy to compute frequent rental points, you are
required to add two new strategies:

a. The first new frequent rental point computation gives double regular points to any customer who is
renting more than two types of movies.

b. The first new frequent rental point computation gives double regular points to any customer who is
18-22 and renting one or multiple new release movies.

You can work in a group of at most 2 students.

## Notes about the runner class
- Eugene McDermott's transaction is designed to show the 18-22 strategy
- Linus Torvalds's transaction is designed to show the >2 types of movies strategy
- Grady Booch's transaction is designed to show the default strategy (no double points)
